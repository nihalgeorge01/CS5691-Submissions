1. It shows PDF (gaussians) for different classes and their contours (constant density curves).
2. It shows Decision Boundary, Decision Surface(the pink,yellow and blue color) and constant density curves with it.
3. Comparative ROC and DET curves. (It should be in this way only!!!)
4. It just shows the PDF(gaussians) for each class.
5. It just shows the constant density curves (contours) and eigenvectors.
6. Decision Boundary and decision surface. Self Descriptive
7. Confusion matrices. (You may not give all in the report)
